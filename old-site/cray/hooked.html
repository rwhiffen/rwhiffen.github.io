<P>I won't sit here and tell everyone that I've know about Robert
Cray from the beginning. I found out about him like the majority of
fans did: Strong Persuader. After I heard Strong Persuader at my
friend Wayne's house, I was hooked. After going quite a while of not
buying any music, and having no blues radio stations where I lived
in the country. (Rural Minnesota isn't exactly a blues hot bed).  I
missed Don't Be Afraid of the Dark when it came out. I found out
about it and Midnight Stroll after having some extra cash and an urge
to buy new music as a Sophomore in college. I saw both cassettes
there and thought WOW! I've fallen behind! Little did I know then
that <IMG SRC="Images/band2.gif"

ALIGN=left>there were 4 before the 3 I now had. A bought I Was Warned
when I heard a song off of it from KUMD one of the local college
radio stations. Then when Shame + a Sin came out, I saw an interview
on VH1 where they asked him about this being his 8th album. I thought
to my self, 8? I only have 4. Off I went. Looking high and low for
Cray! I found 3 at one store. They was only one problem, they
were all on CD and I didn't have a CD player yet. (Poor College
student still). No matter! Charge it! Bought a CD Player and the CDs.
Now I had to wait for Shame + A Sin to be released. When it came out
a week or two later, I snatched it up. I had a good collection of
Robert Cray at that time. I had a few problems though, Half of them
where on cassette, the other half were on CD. So, I bought the
cassette versions on CD. What can you do when you have to have Cray?
Kind of like an addiction at this point. I was driving back from
Stevens Point Wisconsin in the summer of '95, I tuned into WOJB 87.9
on a monday night. (WOJB is the radio station for the Lac Coutre
Orielles (I know I'm not spelling that right) Reservation ) It
happened to be blues night and they were playing tunes off of the new
CD by Robert Cray. Yikes! I'd missed yet another one! So I went and
bought that one. Just to be sure, I ran it through the music computer
at the record store and they had a listing for Who's Been Talking. It
was an early recording. Anyway, It seems my quest for a complete collection 
will never end.

<P>Just another story about how the internet is improving life....<BR>
Thanks to the Internet and 
<A HREF="http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/robertcrayfanclub">The Robert Cray fan 
club</A> on Yahoo!  http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/robertcrayfanclub (stop on
by!) I <B>a lot</B> about the Take Your Shoes Off CD before it was even 
released. It's great to talk to other Robert Cray fans like myself.   We all
agree that "He's done it again."  Take Your Shoes Off is another fine Cray
album.

 In 1999 I found a copy of Who's Been Talking in album format
in a record store in Arlington, VA (D.C. Suburb).  Now I have all the American
releases.  Next I have to get the U.K. releases ;-).
