<P>A quick note about the three albums.  They are the same in most respects. 
 The key differences are from the record companies that released them.  
"But it says two were both released by Tomato on the web page!?!?" Well, 
there's a period of time when Tomato went out of business.  During that 
time, Atlantic re-released <I>Who's Been Talking</I>.  They basically bought
the rights to the album.  When Tomato records went back into business (I'm 
not sure of who, how, or why this happened, I've pieced this together as 
best I can) they wanted to re-release <I>Who's Been Talking</I> but Atlantic
still owned the rights, but they didn't own the rights to an ablum called 
<I>Too Many Cooks</I>.
<I>New Blues</I> on the other hand is a re-release of the ablum by Hallmark,
a UK label.  The track order and disc art has changed, but thats it. They 
are all essentially the same disc.  Many thanks again to Jim for obtaining a
copy for me!
  </P>
<P>That's the best explaination I can give for the three albums.  Since they
all look so different, and as far as I know, the <I> Who's been Talkin'</I> 
version has never been released on CD, I count them as separate albums.</P>
<P>
<B>Update:</B> Who's Been Talkin' has been produced in two more versions! 
 One from Neon and one from Mercury.  The Mercury release has the original
 cover art and has been digitally remastered</P>
