<b>Comments:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>I was exposed to best kept secret in music back in 1987 when Robert was opening for E.C. I had Strong Persuader with me at a party 2 days before the show,demanding to play it for everyone. My friend who worked 4 a music store said to follow him upstairs,he breaks out W.B.T., B.I. and F.A. He said,"this guy is gonna rock your soul when he takes the stage,so take these discs and be prepaired for it because he is the best kept secret on the scene. After I saw my first show I knew what he meant and felt like I was let in on something special. Truly the man and his talents touch the soul. See you at BB Kings in June and the page is great, thanks for creating it. Check out my pics in the yahoo group</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

<b>Comments:</B><BLOCKQUOTE> I.ve been really listening to the latest release Time Will Tell CD and Iam trying to learn the first 3 tunes Survivor, which Ive been playing in B flat minor to F maj to C# maj and then some in standard tuning also been trying to get a hold on Up In The Sky, which I.ve been playing with a minor roll off of the d string at the 9th. fret to F maj to g then c and d maj and then some Iam going to purchase a DOD Swami effect pedal to get that sitar sound live and will use my Twin reverb with a Uni-Vibe on the Vibrato channel to get that shake sound in the guitar. I have been working on Backdoor Slam but just the bass lines with the little noodlings  that Robert does in the key of C ...IF ANYONE HAS ANY SUGGESTIONS ON CHORDS OR LYRICS TO THESE PLEASE E-MAIL ME I HAVE WRITTEN DOWN MOST OF THE LYRICS TO THESE THREE EXCEPT THE ONE LINE ON UP IN THE SKY SOUNDS LIKE OIL NIGURATE! THE LINE BEFORE IT IS ABOUT THE KID THAT'S TAUGHT TO HATE...ROBERT IF YOUR READING THIS... GIVE IT UP!  I met Robert at the Long Beach Blues Festival 1987 and he signed my program then and I met Robert at the Marroit hotel in Long Beach in about 1996 and had him sign my pre-CBS stratocaster he seems to really like my old strat that nite he did a great job on his autograph..To Ray All My Best Robert Cray. I.ve been playing this old strat s/n-20313 since I saw Robert at the Galaxy Theater a few weeks ago it had been retired but I had to pull it out to try these new tunes and the guitar with Roberts autograph, me in my studio a beer or 4 and me doing my homework again...I haven't done this much guitar homework since I worked on Band Of Gypsys...Robert if you can e-mail me about those tunes there's no Tab anywhere on the net, I was the guy standing rite in front of you at the Galaxy wearing my Buddy Miles t-shirt......Thanks</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

<b>Comments:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>Oh, for those "good ol' daze"! I have loved the man and the music since the first time I laid eyes and ears on him in those very early days of the band. (Prior to the release of "Too Many Cooks".)Small, smokey club ("The Place")in Eugene, when there was a dollar or two cover to get in and see them! I, and many others knew from the very first listen that this man was/is destined for greatness in this genre! I can't verify this 100%, but a friend of mine in those early days claimed Robert and Richard actually stayed in his garage when they first got to Eugene from the Seattle/Tacoma area....Can you even imagine some of the great jam sessions that must've taken place there? And, would you even believe that I "almost"(!?) got my lip-prints featured on the cover of what was discussed as one possibility to be called the "Phone Booth" album, but was eventually titled "Bad Influence"??! 'Course, I would've loved that, but still treasure many fond memories, and look forward to many more to come! Keep up the smooth grooves, Robert! Love Ya!</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

I am very young, 14, but I LOVE Robert Cray. I haven't seen him in concert, but I would absolutely LOVE to. I know all of his songs, hands down. I have been listening to Robert Cray my ENTIRE life, and I have all of his CDs. My dad got me into it and blues is my favorite, with Cray on top of it all of course.

<b>Comments:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>Dear Robert Cray fans, I have some great Cray memoribilia for sale cheap. I've been a Cray fan since I first saw him at the Eugene Hotel in 1978.  For a time I kept a Cray file with the first Rolling Stone Cray cover, the New Yorker article, Guitar Player mag cover, Musician mag cover, Downbeat article and numerous local newspaper clippings.  I am ready to let some other Robert Cray fan enjoy it and have it all for only $30 US.  I'll gladly mail it to you.  I used to see Cray perform in Portland and Seattle clubs and was always amazed and moved by his playing, singing, humor and dignity. His recordings and performances continue to delight me.  Let me know if you want my Robert Cray file collection.  Murl  </BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

I've been a big fan of Young Bob for about a decade now but this was the first time I got to see him live. To say I was blown away is a huge understatement.

<b>Comments:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>Hope I don't get too many screams from you Robert Cray fans. I recently bought the newest album Shoulda Been Home. I must admit I didn't thoroughly enjoy it the first couple of times I listened to it. But, I kept on listening to it and now I do enjoy it. Although the first time I listened to it I absolutely loved the 2nd cut Already Gone. I also must admit that I was not aware of Robert Cray until a couple of months ago. I was at my favorite blues club in Nashville, Bourbon Street Blues&Boogie Bar, and the house band, Stacy Mitchhart&Blues-U-Can-Use covered his tune Right Next Door(Because of Me). The next day I found out it was on the Strong Persuader album and went and bought it. I hope to buy more of his cd in the near future.</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

The local musicians and serious listeners would all show up and Robert would make time stand still.  He often traveled with a six piece band back then and he shared vocals with Curtis Salgado, a fine R&B singer in his own right.  We figured that Robert might become famous someday, and we could say, " you know, you should have heard him back when ... "     all good wishes   , rr :)</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

<b>Comments:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>No one was a bigger Cray fan than I, but sorry to say, his latest material blows.  I feel that his albums were consistently good through Some Rainy Morning, and even Sweet Potato Pie was o.k., but after that, straight downhill.  Regardless of albums, Robert Cray, like MOST blues artists, must be truly appreciated live.  The last time I saw him was in Indianapolis at their 1st Annual Blues Fest, when he followed (then newcomer) Susan Tedeschi.  He should have been embarrassed of his own song selection, because after she came out and played her set (very appropriate for a FESTIVAL crowd) he came out there and put everyone to sleep.  Not to mention that he was on the same bill that day with BB King, Bobby "Blue" Bland, and others.  To add insult to injury, he played a few days later in my hometown of Louisville asking a ticket price of $40.  Needless to say, I didn't waste my money.  This all comes from someone who sang Cray's praises for years and truly knows the show he's capable of.  So I say to you, Cray fans:  Demand better, and if you don't get it, let him just go away.</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

He is by far one of the most talented individuals out there today.Is there anyone else who can write, play, and sing with the pure emotion like he can? I THINK NOT! Although I've only seen him twice, I would consider them both as 2 of my favorite concerts. Luckily for us true fans, Robert still plays the local small clubs. Do yourself (and a friend) a favor. Go to the next show in your area. Drive for a while if you have to, it WILL be worth it. And yes, that is him in "Animal House"</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

<b>Comments:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>Been a Cray fan for about 15 years when I heard "Who's Been Talkin'" while working in College Radio.  That did it for me!  Finally saw him in concert at the Long Beach Blues Festival this year.  Awesome!  He plays the cleanest solos around, each note distinct and important as the ones on either side of it.  My favorite album is "Showdown!" with Johnny Copeland and Albert Collins - for my money the best modern blues album.</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

<b>Comments:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>He's the man alright.  I like the webpage and admire the dedication of RICH!  He is "a true believer" (to quote another great artwork).Best Cray album has GOT to be whichever one you heard first.  The one which gave you the buzz for his sound.  Personally it has got to be Strong Persuader,as each track evokes images in my mind similar to a music video.  Currently I am writing an assignment for University based on publishing rights, distribution, sales figures, etc, so I must get a move on, (and get a groove on kind-of-thing).

<b>Comments:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>Saw Robert yesterday at the finale of the Boston Globe Jazz Fest. Outdoor free gig at the Hatch Shell, Neville Bros. opened up. Robert's guitar was tight and clear as a bell. His singing continues to amaze me. Unbelievable range - hits the high notes repeatedly and with ease, and then gets gritty and low down in the same line. Keyboards were also great. Played "Forecast Calls for Pain" in honor of the threatening rainclouds over head (they listened and then left, no rain thankfully). Also played Smoking Gun at end. Did a blistering song for a finale that had 15,000-20,000 people on their feet, chorus went "what i thought had just begun has just become our last time." Great song - what is it? Also, does anyone know the song they've been playing right before the band hits the stage? Something about "ace of spades" and "stay with the one that brought you." Not a Cray song but sounds like them kind of - old song. If anyone knows please e-mail me.</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

<b>Comments:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>The first time I was introduced to Robert Cray was in the Summer of '87. I had a 5 1/2 year relationship that was coming to an end, because of...you guessed it...two deceptive experiences on her part. A friend said to me...ever heard of this guy (RC).  He gave me a tape of "Strong Persuader". I thought to myself as I listened, "God this guy is singing about what I am feeling!"  I was hooked.

I started getting his old stuff.  I had the chance to see him at Bowdoin College in early '88 and at the Civic Center in Portland in '89.  Just Great! Oh man...what a guitarist...and the rest of the band was sensational!

I used to tell people who had never heard of him that he sang on 3 themes...my girlfriend screwed me over and this is how I feel...my wife screwed me over and this is how I feel...I screwed my sister-in-law and this is how I feel.  LOL. And now that he has gotten older the vision one gets has changed.

During the 90's I've been able to catch him at all of his Maine performances.  His best was at the State Theatre in '96.  Something about starting the show with "The Forecast Calls For Pain" really sets the mood. If anyone has any live shows in their collection I would love to trade.  I have the Springfield show from '89, but would love to have more. Please email.

Thank you Robert for your fine guitar work and sharing your great talent for telling it the way it was, and like a fine wine you are getting better with age. </BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

<b>Comments:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>I just found this and want to say it's really cool that there are such great sites and so many Robert Cray fans out there.  I hadn't been too familiar with him until last summer, when I heard that one of the great bluesmen of modern times was going to be playing at Hampton Beach (anyone elso go to that show?).  Well, my brother and I bought a pair of tickets, grabbed a copy of "Take Your Shoes off" to warm up (wow, by the way) and headed out to the show full of expectations.  They were met in full.  He is certainly one of those musicians who doesen't waste any notes, like Clapton of BB.  There was energy in each one, and the band was spectacular too.  I can best remember that show by an older man sitting a few tables down from me who looked like he not only knew the blues, but lived them (though cliche, it really seemed to represent him).  Well, he remained unwaivered through the opening acts, but when RC stepped in, you could see that he was taken back a few decades and could feel that intensity.What a show.</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

<b>Comments:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>Strange goings-on in the UK. Yesterday I picked up, in a record shop in Birmingham, England, a Robert Cray CD entitled "New Blues" which cost me £2.99 (that's not very many dollars). It turns out to be yet another reissue of Cray's first album, but with the tracks in a different order to "Who's Been Talkin'" or "Too Many Cooks." It is published by the UK label "Hallmark" which specialises in ridiculously cheap reissues. I am obviously pleased to own this, but we do now have the strange situation of having three albums which contain the same ten tracks but all in different orders and with different names. So if anyone in the UK sees "New Blues" and already has "Too Many Cooks" or "Who's Been Talkin'," don't bother buying it. Otherwise, snap it up, because you won't get this album any cheaper under any of its many names.</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

<b>Comments:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>I've been a fan of young Bobs for many years but didn't really think I'd get to see him live because I live in the UK and the chances to see him over here are few and far between but luckily I found a date in Manchester over the web.
What can I say? When Bob came on stage I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. After so many years listening and wanting to see him for real I couldn't believe it was actually happening to me.
It was so nice to see that the man can play and it's not just a trick of the studio. With such a talent, why aren't more people in the UK aware of this man.
My only moan is that I went to the gig with £150 in my pocket for merchandise and the only thing to buy was the "Take your shoes off" CD which I bought on the release date. I could go on for hours extoling (dodgey spelling) the virtues of this mans music but this message is probably far too long anyway so I'll shut up.
Next year I want to come over to the states to see YB so if anyone can furnish me with appropriate dates and places to stay I would really apprecite it.
All of you YB fans out there have my heartiest congratulations on being such well adjusted individuals.
All the best

Great stuff. I've been listening to his music since the mid 80's and have enjoyed all his albums I've bought so far. Still got some to buy though. Bought his latest from a record fair in Canterbury, Kent recently and got into it straight away.
It may have been packaged in that nasty cardboard stuff but the CD was really something which is what counts. I'll go to one of his shows one of these days. There are two coming up in July but a bit out of the way for me. I think the Mercury Web page should get more up to date. Sweet Potato Pie? Never heard of it; only his latest!

I think your site is great! I am a big Robert Cray Fan.
I'm also a singer in a blues band, and have had a few opportunities
to perform with one of Robert's former band members...none other
than David Olsen, drummer on 5 or 6 of his CD's. David left
Robert Cray before "Midnight Stroll" came out. If you live
in the upstate New York area (Syracuse, Rochester, Binghamton,etc.
you can see David Olsen perform with a 3 piece band called
Phil Petroff and Natural Fact. They are a favorite attraction
at The Amsterdam in Johnson City, N.Y. and the Dinosaur Barbecue
in Syracuse, N.Y. 
FYI..David Olsen is the one with glasses, pictured on the left
in the photo for "Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark"
Check it out. I think your site is the best Robert Cray site

I'VE WORN OUT 2 COPIES OF "STRONG PERSUADER" AND TRYING TO DO THE SAME TO "SOME RAINY MORNING" AND "SWEET TATER". HIS MUSIC ALWAYS BRINGS ME BACK TO MY REAL SELF AFTER A STRESSFUL DAY OR WHEN I'M DEPRESSED. IT'S HELPED ME MAKE IT THROUGH THICK & THIN. I LIKE THE LOOKS I GET FROM PEOPLE WHEN I HAVE HIS MUSIC PLAYING AT WORK AND THEY START GROOVIN TO IT. IT'S FUNNY WHEN THEY ASK WHO THE BAND IS THATS PLAYING THAT MUSIC AND I SAY "ROBERT CRAY" THEY USUALLY ASK ME WHERE THEY CAN FIND HIS C.D.'S. I HOPE I GET TO SEE HIM IN CONCERT SOMEDAY SOON, MAYBE IN ST.LOUIS, KANSAS CITY OR DALLAS?

<b>Comments:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>Really Surprised to read Max's comments about YB's last two albums not being well recieved. For me, and others I know, his last is his greatest! I suppose it depends what attracts you though. I believe that there are many who can perform conventional blues adequately and I think that a lot of early YB material could come into this category. However! to my mind his music has matured and works from his last such as 'Not Bad For Love', 'Little Birds' and 'Simple Things' represent some of the finest Soul/R&B/Blues music to be created in since Otis was killed. No one else today is capable of work of this calibre.</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

I may have lost one of them but I know I have one in my collection of over 2000 record albums stored in my barn. I believe that Robert lost some of the energy his music had when he started producing his own albums. Your survey seems to show that his last 2 albums are not as well recieved. He is one of the best just the same, Max.</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

<b>Comments:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings fellow Cray fans..(I like the term Crayons) I have been A fan since his breakthrough album "Strong Persuader" and I have never looked back. I have seen him  perform live 9 times and have yet to be disapointed. He is a truly gifted vocalist, guitarist, and song writer....An all to rare musical triple threat. 

   Has anyone seen him perform the song "I Wonder" live in concert? It is one of my favorites and I have yet to hear it live. 

    Although I enjoy his newer material...In my humble opinion his earlier material was better....more bluesy ..not as polished. 

   I have now thrown my two cents in...one last thing....Robert Cray is long over due for a live recording!!</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

The latest show I watched was at The Puyallup Fair (Western Washington State Fair)on 9/24/98.The weather was pretty bad but it was not bad enough to ruin the great performance. The band played one of the best sets I've seen yet! Here is the list of songs... Nothing against you, I shiver, I'll go on, Where do I go from here, Right next door, Our last time, The one in the middle, Bad influences,Smoking gun,Good enough for me,Things you do to me, and Phone booth.  GREAT SHOW! GREAT BAND!</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

<b>Comments:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>Nice job on your page. I can relate to most of the folks in your guest book who love his work. ... I, like you, got my first shot of Robert Cray with the release of "Strong Persuader." I remember wearing out the cassette and then getting in on CD. I've since faithfully bought each release, and I look forward to each one to come. I've seen him four times -- in San Francisco, Napa, Fresno and since I moved to Arkansas in 1995, I was lucky enough to catch him last October in Fayetteville. It was a great birthday present from my wonderful girlfriend, who was treated to her first Cray concert.
Tough to pick a favorite song or album, but I tend to play "Strong Persuader" and "Midnight Stroll" the most. Thanks again for the site.</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

soulfulness unequalled for many sad years in R&B. But as
the records continue to flow, a maturing voice has really stepped into the spotlight. If you haven't checked out
PUMPKIN PIE, I highly suggest it.
  One other note, check out Johnny Lee Hooker's album

He is so good and such a great performer and he appeas to be having so much fun.

For the sanity of all in Blighty, I sincerely hope that Robert can find time to do a "tour".
Let me explain.
A "tour" is where an artist performes SEVERAL gigs and not just two. Also
A tour is where the artist performs in SEVERAL DIFFERENT CITIES AND TOWNS and not just
London or Manchester. Come on man, spread the word a little.

I HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING ROBERT CRAY MANY TIMES OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, ALWAYS A GREAT SHOW.  LAST YEAR GOT TO SEE BOB AS PART OF THE BLUES FESTIVAL WITH BB AND ALSO ON HIS OWN WITH THE BAND.  SINCE I CAN NEVER GET ENOUGH CRAY I WOULD ALWAYS SUGGEST TRYING TO SEE THE BAND WHEN IT PERFORMS ALONE JUST BECAUSE IT'S ALL BOB!!!  I HAVE ALREADY BEEN CHECKING OUT HIS TOUR DATES FOR 1998 AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE'LL BE DOING SOME MORE DRIVING TO MAKE SURE WE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE CLOSEST DATES.  THE CRAY SHOWS ARE ALWAYS GREAT AND IF YOU LIKE HIS MUSIC YOU MUST SEE HIM LIVE.  MY FAVORITE CRAY SONGS [ITS HARD TO CHOOSE] ARE I CAN'T QUIT {SWEET POTATO PIE},I WAS WARNED (ALBUM OF THE SAME NAME),SOME PAIN,SOME SHAME,I SHIVER (BOTH FROM SHAME & A SIN) TOO MANY FAVORITES TO MENTION!                  </BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

I got Strong Persuader a couple of months ago - (brilliant), and 'Right Next Door' is an amazing song like U said.
Anyway, could I offer a suggestion. If you ever see 'Blind To Reason', by an artist called Grayson Hugh you should definitely get it as it is a similar sort of record to Cray's, although
it leans more toward gospel than blues (but by all means get this album U will not be dissapointed).</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

Anyway, could I offer a suggestion. If you ever see 'Blind To Reason', by an artist called Grayson Hugh you should definitely get it as it is a similar sort of record to Cray's, although
it leans more toward gospel than blues (but by all means get this album U will not be dissapointed).</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

Oneof my favorite tunes is "Playin in the Dirt" I called out to him to play it and he did! For me, he is a consumate performer. His voice is like melted honey.

<b>Comments:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>The first time I heard Robert was in my friend A.J.'s van on the way to a San Francisco Giant's game. He had Strong Persuader playing and I was immediately drawn to his voice, guitar, and style. He was so smooth. Since then I've seen him live at the Long Beach Blues Festival, Hollywood Bowl, in the Bay Area, Eugene OR, and Jacksonville OR. He has only disappointed once (Hollywood Bowl) and always left me thinking about the show for a few day after. Overall, I would rank "I Was Warned" as his best CD in terms of diversity and showing what he is capable of musically. Some of my favorite tunes of his include I've Slipped Her Mind, The Price I Pay, Walkaround Time, Your Secret's Safe, and Little Boy Big. I'd really like to see him tour with a more complex band of horns and backup singers and then release a live CD. I would not miss that one...</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

<b>Comments:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>EDf said it all! "listining to Robert Cray makes me feel like someone understands" I just had th fortune to see Robert live again here in Tulsa with BB King and Jimmy Vaughn, great show! I have a question that some of you more seasoned Cray fans might be able to answer for me? Cray did a song (did not give name) at the show that told about a couple who have been together for a long time, and some of the lyric's said things like  "after 20 years, you still love me",  "after everything I have done, you still care" (or something to that affect) Well needless to say my wife and I turned toward each other after the song and both had the same "we have got to get that song, it will be OUR SONG" look in our eyes! I dont have all of Cray's recordings, and dont know the name of it or what CD it is from! Help us, please!  Thanks, Danny and Janice

<b>Comments:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>This is my first time on the internet, and I was very pleased to find this webpage.  I am a huge Robert Cray fan.  I have seen him in concert about 10 times, in several different venues in Seattle.  I was also lucky enough to mean Robert and former bassist Richard Cousins on December 26th several years back (around the time that Strong Persuader came out).  My brother and I were in a used record store, of all places, in Seattle.  Along with the store employee, we were the only three people in the store.  Then in walks Robert and Richard.  Of course we had to tell them what big fans we were.  I am here to tell you, not only is his music great, but Robert is a great person.  He was very friendly and appreciative of what we had to say.  May his music, and the blues in general, live on forever.

One of the best things about it is how "bluesy" it is. Bob doesn't do too many traditional blues songs anymore - this is a side of him you really don't get to see anymore. No fan of the Cray Band should be without this classic.</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

I am simply blown away by his talent.  In my opinion, he was the best performer of the show.  I've always liked his music and being a musician myself makes me appreciate and respect him even more.  His soulful voice and guitar playing make him one of my favorite artists and I can assure you I will be following him much more closely than I have been.  He's simply an incredible musician!  </BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

A large portion of the croud came to hear Robert's voice and strong chords. This could be seen by
the fact that a least a quarter of the crowd left after he finished or shortly after Steve began.
Something about he makes ya shiver with joy. Saw him again in 92' and again in 93' when he played for
