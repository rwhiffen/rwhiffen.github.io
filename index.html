  <p> so in the python class I'm taking we're doing basic HTML and CSS to
    get us ready for some advanced python web dev stuff.  So this is my
    placeholder page where I can practice the CSS style sheet stuff.  I remember
    enough of the HTML syntax from way back when that I don't feel the need to
    practice that. </p>
